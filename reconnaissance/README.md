# Maltego

That's the tool for exploration https://www.maltego.com.
It's free, with limitations to 12 records per searched category, and certain date.

## Other WWW-based tools

1. https://whois.domaintools.com - basic information about the owner of the target.
2. https://sitereport.netcraft.com - technologies used by the target.
3. https://www.robtex.com - comprehensive information about the target. The `search` functionality doesn't work by showing `404` on each query. Apply it directly from the URL, for example, `https://www.robtex.com/dns-lookup/cbr.ru`, then change the `cbr.ru` to your desired target. Some more detailed sections require you to log in with `Google` Single Sign On (SSO).
